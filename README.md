## Overview

The `Firmware_Practice` directory includes a collection of C/C++ programming exercises focused on firmware development. 
Each exercise is designed to tackle common problems and scenarios encountered in embedded systems programming.

## Setup

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Firmware_Practice.git
    cd Firmware_Practice
    ```

2. **Compile the code**:
    Use `gcc` or any other C compiler to compile the code. For example:
    ```sh
    gcc -o output_file source_file.c
    ```

3. **Run the executable**:
    ```sh
    ./output_file
    ```

## Questions

Below is a list of questions included in this directory along with brief descriptions:

1. **DynArrAlloc.c**
    - **Description**: This program is a custom memory allocator that mimics the behavior of malloc using a 
                       fixed-size memory pool.

2. **FindFirstRepeatElement_Int.c**
    - **Description**: This program finds the first repeated integer in an array.

3. **Queue4ISRHandle.c**
    - **Description**: This program implements a circular queue data structure for simulating handling 
                       of interrupts in embedded systems.

4. **FindRepeatLogMsg.c**
    - **Description**: This program identifies the first repeated log message in an array of log messages.
