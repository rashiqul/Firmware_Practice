# Ignore binary files with the same name as .c files but without extensions
# For example, if you have source files like main.c, utils.c, etc.

# Add more patterns as needed for other .c files

# Alternatively, you can use a more general pattern if you have many .c files
# This pattern will ignore any file without an extension that has a corresponding .c file
