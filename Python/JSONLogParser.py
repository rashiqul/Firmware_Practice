# JSON Parsing and Error Analysis in a Jenkins Pipeline
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Imagine youâ€™re working on a vehicle diagnostics system that uses Jenkins for continuous integration. 
# The system captures test results and stores them in a list of dictionaries, each containing test metadata, 
# including the test_name, status (pass/fail), failure_reason (if failed), and duration (in seconds).
#
# Problem:
# Write a Python function analyze_pipeline_tests(tests: list) -> dict, that:
# - Identifies all tests that have failed and groups them by failure_reason.
# - Calculates the average duration for tests that passed.
# - Returns a dictionary in the following format:
#   - {
#       "failure_summary": { "<failure_reason>": ["test_name1", "test_name2", ...] },
#       "average_duration_passed_tests": <float>
#     }
#
